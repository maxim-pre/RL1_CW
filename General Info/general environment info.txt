Action space:

- motor speed between -1 and 1 for each joint (there are 4 joints).
- Total: vector of length 4

State space:

- Head angular speed
- angular velocity
- horizontal speed
- vertical speed
- position of each joint (4)
- angular speed of each joint (4)
- legs contact with ground (2)
- 10 lidar rangefinder measurements
- Total: vector of length 24.

Rewards:

- Reward is given for moving forward, totaling 300+ points if reaching end.
- If the robot falls, it gets -100.
- Applying motor torque costs a small amount of points.
- A more optimal agent will get a better score.

Levels:

- 2 Levels, Normal and Hardcore.
- To solve the normal, need to get 300 points (reach end) in 1600 time steps.
- To solve the hardcore, need 300 points (reach end) in 2000 time steps.
